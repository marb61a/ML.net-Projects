Notes from Rubikscode ML.net course
    - https://rubikscode.net/courses/ml-net-full-stack-machine-learning-for-net-developers/
    - Machine Learning for .Net developers

    - https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning

I am very interested in ML.net as .net is used in RPA tools which gives some benefits
    - Learning C# based machine learning which can be used not only in RPA tools
    - https://docs.uipath.com/ai-fabric/v0/docs/building-ml-packages

There are some pre-requisites for the course
    - VSCode and Visual Studio 2022
        - .net 6 comes with the IDE installation
    - .net Interactive VSCode extension
    - The notebooks involved are similar to Jupyter notebooks
    - C# will be used instead of Python but will be used in an almost script-like manner

There are some datasets that will be used within the course
    - Palmer Penguins Dataset, Boston Housing Dataset, Netflix Prize Dataset, IMDb Sentiment Dataset and Cats vs Dogs

History of Machine Learning
    - https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/A-Timeline-of-Machine-Learning-History
    - https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-machine-learning/
    - Machine Learning is no longer an obscure topic
    - Data volumes have increased by orders of magnitude in the last few years
        - By 2025 expected to be around 200 Zettabytes
        - A zettabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 10 to the power of 21
    - Machine Learning and Deep Learning are very in demand skills
    - A quick definition of Machine Learning
        - Machine Learning is the branch of computer science which uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn
    - Learning in this context means gaining the ability to perform tasks to success rates through experience
    - Machine Learning tries to solves problems that are tough to solve by people or standard software
        - Problems include classification, regression, forecasting and anomaly detection

Gradient Descent
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent
    - https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html
    - Gradient Descent is the essential optimization technique and one of the main ingredients of some algorithms
        - It is the most popular optimisation technique and the basis for all others
