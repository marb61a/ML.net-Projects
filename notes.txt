Notes from Rubikscode ML.net course

I am very interested in ML.net as .net is used in RPA tools which gives some benefits
    - Learning C# based machine learning which can be used not only in RPA tools

There are some pre-requisites for the course
    - VSCode and Visual Studio 2022
        - .net 6 comes with the IDE installation
    - .net Interactive VSCode extension
    - The notebooks involved are similar to Jupyter notebooks
    - C# will be used instead of Python but will be used in an almost script-like manner

There are some datasets that will be used within the course
    - Palmer Penguins Dataset, Boston Housing Dataset, Netflix Prize Dataset, IMDb Sentiment Dataset and Cats vs Dogs
